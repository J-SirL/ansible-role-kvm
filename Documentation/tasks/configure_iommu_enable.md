Certainly! Below is an example of how you might structure your Markdown documentation for the `JsirL.kvm` Ansible role, detailing the newly added functionality to enable IOMMU. This documentation can be included in your role's `README.md` file:

# JsirL.kvm Ansible Role

## Overview

This Ansible role, `JsirL.kvm`, facilitates the setup and configuration of KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). This role automates various tasks related to managing virtual machines using KVM on AlmaLinux 9.

## Enabling IOMMU Configuration

This role now includes a new feature to enable IOMMU on AlmaLinux 9 systems. IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) is essential for improving performance and security in virtualized environments.

### Prerequisites

- Ansible is installed on the control node.
- AlmaLinux 9 is the target operating system.

### Usage

Include the `configure_iommu_enable.yml` file in your playbook or task file to enable IOMMU on the targeted hosts.

Example playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: your_target_hosts
  roles:
    - JsirL.kvm
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: JsirL.kvm
        tasks_from: configure_iommu_enable.yml
```

### Playbook Structure

The `configure_iommu_enable.yml` file is structured as follows:

- **Tasks:**  
  - Checks the system's boot mode (BIOS or UEFI).
  - Modifies GRUB configuration to enable IOMMU based on the detected boot mode (BIOS or UEFI).
  - Uses conditional statements (`when`) to determine the appropriate GRUB configuration file location.
  
- **Handlers:**  
  - Updates GRUB settings in the appropriate directory based on the system's boot mode.
  - Triggers a system reboot if changes are made successfully.

### Important Notes

- Replace `your_target_hosts` with the appropriate host or group of hosts from your Ansible inventory.
- Verify the playbook execution and review changes before running in a production environment.
